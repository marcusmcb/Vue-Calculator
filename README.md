# Vue Calculator

This is a simple calculator app built using Vue.js.  I wanted to try out a coding library I was previously unfamiliar with and landed on Vue.

If you've used a calculator before the functionality will be pretty familiar.

Built using the Vue init starter code as a base template and modified using standard Vue, JS and CSS components for the styling and functionality.

To run this app you will need to have Node and the necessary Vue-related NPMs installed.
